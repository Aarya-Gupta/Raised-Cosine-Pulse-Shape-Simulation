# Simulating Raised Cosine Pulse Shape

This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate the raised cosine pulse shape from scratch, as instructed. The simulation generates both time and frequency domain representations of the sinc waveform and the raised cosine waveform for different roll-off factors.

## Instructions

### Simulate Raised Cosine Pulse Shape
1. Simulate the raised cosine pulse shape from scratch.
2. Plot the sinc waveform and the raised cosine waveform for roll-off factors r = 0.5 and r = 0.75 in a single figure. The plot should contain three pulses: the sinc pulse and two raised cosine pulses of varying roll-off factors.

### Frequency Domain Representation
3. Plot the frequency domain representation of the pulses depicted in the first part. Ensure that the three pulses overlap in the plot. Clearly depict the additional bandwidth occupied by the raised cosine pulses compared to the sinc pulse, and point out the bandwidth relationship between these pulses (which pulse occupies maximum bandwidth and which occupies the least).
